# ImageSearch

main.py takes two arguments, the first one is the big star map image path, the other one is the patch that we are looking for. It returns an array containing 4 point coordinates of small star patch in big star map.

I have experimented with Canopus.jpg and smallstar.png which is cropped from rotated Canopus.jpg.

I have also included imagematching.ipnb file.
